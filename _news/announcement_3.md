After completing my thesis in 'Function Identification in Android Binaries with Deep Learning' I have been able to write a conference paper on it which has been accepted in [CANDAR'19](https://is-candar.org/program). The conference will be arranged in Nagasaki by the end of November 2019 in Nagasaki Japan.
