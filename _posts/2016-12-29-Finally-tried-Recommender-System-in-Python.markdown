Its been a year I studied this topic during my course in Machine Learning and while having enough understanding of how it works, I never got able to run it as a try due to many factors like matrix factorization, latent features, etc. 
Thanks to python for always making our lives easy, I came across LightFm. LightFM is a Python implementation of a number of popular recommendation algorithms for both implicit and explicit feedback.
So far the best part of this library is the hybrid implementation of both collaborative and content-based recommendation systems. So by taking help from [Lightfm](https://github.com/lyst/lightfm) and their documentation I wrote (i mean copy pasted OBVIOUSLY) a simple python code. I will continue exploring it.
