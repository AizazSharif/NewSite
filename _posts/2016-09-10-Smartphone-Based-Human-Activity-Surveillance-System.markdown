With the ability to use Machine Learning within Android app, it can recognize, record and visualize basic human 6 physical activities like walking, running, sitting, standing, upstairs and downstairs in REAL TIME.

That was my Final Year Project and now I am working to extend my work and experience in Data Science and A.I.
